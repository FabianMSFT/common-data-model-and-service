# Overview

Financial services organizations are innovating to provide differentiated and personalized experiences. At the core of this transformation is the ability to tap into the volumes of available data from transactions, life-events, marketing, social, and more. 

The Dynamics 365 Financial Services accelerator allows customers and partners to quickly build industry solutions on Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform. The foundation of the Financial Services accelerator is Microsoft Common Data Model, which includes an industry data model that supports financial services. The Financial Services accelerator includes sample applications, business processes, experiences, and dashboards that use Common Data Model, Dynamics 365, and the Power Platform.

The Financial Services accelerator has the following components:

- [Banking](banking-accelerator.md)

- [Insurance](insurance-accelerator.md)
