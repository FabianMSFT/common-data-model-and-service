# Dynamics 365 automotive accelerator

With the [Dynamics 365 automotive accelerator](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/msauto.msftautomotivecommondatamodel?tab=Overview), you can develop solutions based on entities and attributes that dealerships and OEMs commonly leverage for customer experience and other business processes. These entities include deals, sales contracts, specifications, fleet, warranties, inspection, test drives, branding, business, customer-vehicle relationship, vehicle and equipment, lead, service and after-sales management, and more. The accelerator includes an automotive data model, Power BI apps, canvas and model-driven sample apps based on connected experiences.

The automotive accelerator provides the following to partners and customers:

-   Extensions to Common Data Model to include a data model that supports customer experiences, including entity definitions and relationships.
-	Sample model-driven apps to show some possibilities of how Dynamics 365 and the automotive data model can be used, including customer experience management, customer 360, connected field service, and DMS.
-	Sample canvas apps for the Fleet Manager to quickly and pro-actively schedule service appointments with service centers to show how anyone can quickly develop new apps with the Power Platform using the automotive accelerator.
-	Sample Power BI dashboards that provide analytics around vehicle inventory, services, lead disposition, branding, and business operation. 
-	Sample "Model.json" file to implement the automotive data model as Common Data Model folders in Azure Data Lake Storage for analytics, AI, and Machine Learning.
-	Individual solutions for Sales, After Sales, Marketing, and a package that you can deploy and install, including sample data. The Automotive Common Data Model extension can also be installed using a Power Platform SKU. 
-	Test drive experience through AppSource with walkthroughs, reference guides, entity-relationship diagrams, and metadata documentation on the data model.

## Forms, dashboards, and apps

The Dynamics 365 automotive accelerator can be used with Power Platform or combined with standard Dynamics 365 entities to make it easier to build solutions. This section describes just a few of the forms, views, and dashboards that demonstrate how the automotive accelerator extends the Microsoft Common Data Model, the Power Platform, and Dynamics 365.

### Customer 360 â€“ auto form

The Customer 360 - auto form was released as part of the automotive accelerator V2 release to provide a holistic view of prospects and empowers the sales manager to develop intentional conversations based on customer data and preferences. With this sample app, we demonstrate how a Sales Manager uses customer preferences, leveraged from digital footprints and online journey, to provide a curated experience that delights the customer with personalized offers.

### B2C portal (Power Apps portal)
The Portal highlights the B2C interactions, showcases inventory browsing, car configuration, scheduling test drives, forums, and post activity. It also covers an omnichannel interaction with a bot and highlights the ability to escalate to an agent.

### Service Advisor â€“ Redesigned canvas app

The **Service Advisor** app is completely redesigned to provide holistic view of the daily appointments, car service history, simple access to added value services and other information that empowers the *service advisor* to provide an exceptional customer experience and opportunity to sell additional services and products.

### Vehicle inventory dashboard

Example of Power BI dashboards embedded within Dynamics 365 in the automotive accelerator sample application. With the example vehicle inventory dashboard, the inventory manager can quickly gain insights into total inventory/assets cost, number of available units, aged inventory value percentage  by model year, list price by model year or drill down into inventory breakdown by month received.
