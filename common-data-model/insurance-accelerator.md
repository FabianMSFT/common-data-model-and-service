# Dynamics 365 Financial Services Accelerator - Insurance

The insurance component in the [Dynamics 365 Financial Services Accelerator](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-crm/msfsi.bankingcommondatamodel?tab=Overview) expands the Common Data Model and the Microsoft Power Platform for the insurance industry. The insurance component includes data entities and attributes which span both property and casualty and life insurance and for both producer and agency management use cases. 

The component includes prebuilt solutions, applications, and dashboards for the producer/agent experience as well as for optimizing agency operations. The insurance component integrates seamlessly with the Dynamics 365 Sales application to deliver differentiated policy holder experiences including business processes such as quoting and policy issuance, renewing policies, servicing claims, and recommending insurance products. Additionally, the insurance component can be used alongside the banking component in the Financial Services Accelerator for scenarios and use cases where banking data might be useful.

Currently in preview, the goal of this release is to validate the insurance data model and ensure it meets our customers and partners use cases, the preview of the insurance component includes the following features:

- New insurance entities in the Microsoft Common Data Model which include concepts for insurance spanning the insurance customer, producer, and agency. 
-	An insurance agent application and dashboards, addressing areas like policy management, claims, customer 360, customer onboarding, and insurance agent dashboards
-	A Test Drive experience through [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365/msfsi.bankingcommondatamodel?tab=Overview) with walkthrough and sample data.
