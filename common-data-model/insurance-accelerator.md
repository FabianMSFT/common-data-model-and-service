# Dynamics 365 Financial Services accelerator - Insurance (Preview)

[!INCLUDE cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]

The insurance component in the [Dynamics 365 Financial Services accelerator](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-crm/msfsi.bankingcommondatamodel?tab=Overview) expands Common Data Model and Microsoft Power Platform for the insurance industry. The insurance component includes data entities and attributes which span property, casualty, and life insurance, for both producer and agency management use cases. 

The insurance component includes prebuilt solutions, applications, and dashboards for producers and agents to experience and for optimizing agency operations. The insurance component integrates seamlessly with the Dynamics 365 Sales application to deliver differentiated policy holder experiences, including business processes such as quoting, issuing, and renewing policies, servicing claims, and recommending insurance products. Additionally, the insurance component can be used alongside the banking component in the Financial Services accelerator for scenarios and use cases where banking data might be useful.

Currently in preview, the goal of this release is to validate the insurance data model and ensure it addresses the use cases for Dynamics 365 customers and partners. 

The preview of the insurance component includes these features:

- New insurance entities in Microsoft Common Data Model, including concepts for insurance that span the insurance customer, producer, and agency. 
-	An insurance agent application and dashboard, addressing areas including policy management, claims, customer 360, customer onboarding, and insurance agent dashboards.
-	A [test drive experience](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/msfsi.bankingcommondatamodel?tab=Overview) through AppSource, including walkthrough and sample data.
-	A [package deployment solution](https://experience.dynamics.com/accelerators/).
