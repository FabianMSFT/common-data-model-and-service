# The Dynamics 365 Media and Communications Accelerator (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The [Dynamics 365 Media and Communications Accelerator](https://aka.ms/d365media) expands the Common Data Model and Power Platform into the media & entertainment industries. The V1 Media and Communications Accelerator includes data entities and attributes that center around the theme of “fan & guest engagement”. It includes pre-built solutions around event and venue management, sports management, ticketing and advertising sales, media sponsorships, and various guest interactions such as event registrations and the tracking of loyalty programs. The Media and Communications Accelerator also integrates seamlessly with the Dynamics 365 Sales application and includes fields, forms, views, and dashboards.
The accelerator includes the following features:
- An extension to the Common Data Model to include concepts for fan engagement, including 60+ new entity definitions and relationships.
- 5 unique model-driven applications with new forms and dashboards that support data entry and data management: 
  - Event & venue management
  - Sports management,
  - Ticket sales
  - Guest management
  - Display & advertising sales
- A solution that you can deploy and install from AppSource or GitHub.

## Site-map extensions

With the Dynamics 365 Media and Communications Accelerator, institutions can optimize fan engagement, improve interactions, profile and predict actions of their customers, and gain insights from analytics. When the accelerator is installed in Dynamics 365, the experience is transformed into one specifically built for operators of theme parks, sport venues, theatres, arena, or other places for tourism, hospitality, business conferencing, or the arts. The goal is to allow such institutions to quickly build Power Apps and Power BI visualizations.

Media & entertainment institutions can build their business processes on top of the entities in the accelerator. The ribbon customizations contain entities to record ticketing products, sponsorships, events, venues, sport teams and leagues, and more. 

## Entities and workflows

### Fan and guest management

The media and communications accelerator is intended to help successfully drive the progression of a customer from being an anonymous/casual guest towards being a deeply engaged fan, regular attendee, subscribing member or active member of a frequent buyer/loyalty program. The accelerator solution here helps track that journey with the addition of the new “guest” and “loyalty program” entities which can help eventually convert to leads and then customers and contacts.

### Events and venue management

From scheduling industry events such as conferences, concerts, sporting events, art festivals, to planning all of the attractions, rides, speakers, and concession stands within a venue (theme park, museum, tourist site, e.g.), the media data entities enable powerful ways to activate and connect data gathered from and across your entire event and venue management spectrum.

### Sports management

A key customer target of the fan engagement scenarios within the Media and Communications Accelerator are sports leagues, teams, and organizations that can use the Accelerator to manage and schedule their seasons, games, players, referees, scorers, and other key officials. The Accelerator adds a number of sports-specific data entities and relationships that enables specific use cases for the sports industry. 

### Ticketing sales

The new data entities now include the ability to create solutions around ticketing, reservations and seat management for media companies. This includes the building up of seat maps, the tracking of the seat inventory used within a venue, event, or individual attraction or conference session, and the subsequent productization and sales of individual or group tickets to those events.

### Advertising and sponsorships

This application focuses on the creation and sales of advertising display products, with a key focus on the selling of display messaging at a physical venue (e.g. digital billboards, scoreboards, other signs spread across an arena or theme park). This includes the ability to specify the what, where, and when display advertising will take place as well as track and manage the sale and fulfillment of those advertisements and sponsorships.
