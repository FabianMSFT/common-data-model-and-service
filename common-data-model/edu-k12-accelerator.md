# K-12

## What’s new 

The K12 scenario is released to sit on top of an existing Dynamics 365 instance or Power Platform instance to assist with day to day operations or as a stand-alone data model for developers. The holistic student profile and educator and community engagement scenario contains the data model, installable scenarios (including standard entity attribute extensions, K12 specific education entities, pre-built dashboard and portals, sample data) and other tools to help customers and partners build and deploy new solutions.

The accelerator includes the following features:

- K12 Student and Parent Portal
- Collect School paperwork and forms
- Ability to engage donors and raise funds
- Student Behavior Management Application
- Track and Report Attendance Application and Dashboard

## Site-map extensions

With the Dynamics 365 K12 scenario, schools can optimize student success through optimal understanding of data about the student journey. When the accelerator is installed into Dynamics 365, the experience is transformed into one specifically built for K12 schools and one that allows schools to quickly build Power Apps and Power BI visualizations.

## Forms and dashboards

To better understand and use the available forms and dashboards in this scenario, let’s look it through the personas of a parent, an administrator, or an educator.

## Student and Parent Portal

This portal allows both the parent and student access to the student’s information. From attendance to grades it facilitates clear conversations about progress made by students and caregivers/parents who support their students.
