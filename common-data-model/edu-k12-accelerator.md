# Dynamics 365 education accelerator – K-12

The K-12 component in the Dynamics 365 education accelerator sits on top of an existing Dynamics 365 instance or Power Apps instance to assist with day-to-day operations or as a standalone data model for developers. The holistic student profile, educator, and community engagement scenario contains:

- The data model
- Installable scenarios, including:
  - Standard entity attribute extensions
  - Specific education entities for K-12
  - Pre-built dashboards and portals
  - Sample data
- Other tools to help customers and partners build and deploy new solutions

The accelerator includes the following features:

- K-12 parent and student portal
- Collect School paperwork and forms
- Ability to engage donors and raise funds
- Student Behavior Management application
- Track and Report Attendance application and dashboard

## Site-map extensions

With the K-12 component, schools can optimize student success through understanding data about the student journey. When the accelerator is installed, the experience is transformed into one specifically built for K-12 schools and one that allows schools to quickly build Power Apps and Power BI visualizations.

## Entities and workflows

This accelerator provides these entities to support the needs of K-12 schools:

## Forms, dashboards, and apps

To better understand and use the available forms, dashboards, and apps in this scenario, let’s look it through the personas of a parent, an administrator, or an educator. 

## Parent and student portal

This portal allows both the parent and student access to the student’s information. From attendance to grades it facilitates clear conversations about progress made by students and caregivers/parents who support their students.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal](media/parent-student-portal-1.png "Parent and student portal")

Here students can see all their assignments and progress made with each, as well as focus on a particular subject to see only those assignments.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal - view assignments](media/parent-student-portal-2.png "Parent and student portal - view assignments")

Students can easily check grades and test scores.

They can also check other important details like attendance.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal - check attendance](media/parent-student-portal-4.png "Parent and student portal - check attendance")

They can explore extracurricular activities offered at their schools.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal - activities](media/parent-student-portal-5.png "Parent and student portal - activities")

Parents can also easily update their family information for the school, including important medical forms.

> ![Parent and student portal - update info](media/parent-student-portal-6.png "Parent and student portal - update info")

## Model-driven app

Administrators have a complete view of attendance, courses, internships, accomplishments, extracurricular activities, interventions, assessments, and behavior incidents. The administrator sees this single view to access information for their students and take informed actions to support students.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Administrator view](media/edu-admin-view.png "Administrator view")

## Donor management app

Administrators use the donor app to view and manage donors and update them on how the school is using their donations.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Donor management view](media/edu-donor-mgmt-view.png "Donor management view")

Administrators can also get a clear view of donation designations.

## Student Behavior Management app

Administrators can easily record, track, and encourage positive behavior from students.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Student behavior view](media/behavior-view.png "Student behavior view")

They can also better understand details on how students earned recognition for positive behaviors in class.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Student behavior incident view](media/behavior-view-2.png "Student behavior incident view")

## Track and Report Attendance app 

Educators can easily track and reports attendance in the attendance application. This application can also be modified to use on a table or phone to increase ease of using it.
