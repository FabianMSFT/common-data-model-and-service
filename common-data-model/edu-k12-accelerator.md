# The Dynamics 365 K-12 Accelerator

The K-12 scenario is released to sit on top of an existing Dynamics 365 instance or Power Apps instance to assist with day to day operations or as a standalone data model for developers. The holistic student profile and educator and community engagement scenario contains the data model, installable scenarios (including standard entity attribute extensions, K-12 specific education entities, pre-built dashboard and portals, sample data) and other tools to help customers and partners build and deploy new solutions.

The accelerator includes the following features:

- K-12 Student and Parent Portal
- Collect School paperwork and forms
- Ability to engage donors and raise funds
- Student Behavior Management Application
- Track and Report Attendance Application and Dashboard

## Site-map extensions

With the Dynamics 365 K-12 scenario, schools can optimize student success through optimal understanding of data about the student journey. When the accelerator is installed into Dynamics 365, the experience is transformed into one specifically built for K-12 schools and one that allows schools to quickly build Power Apps and Power BI visualizations.

## Forms and dashboards

To better understand and use the available forms and dashboards in this scenario, let’s look it through the personas of a parent, an administrator, or an educator.

## Parent and Student Portal

This portal allows both the parent and student access to the student’s information. From attendance to grades it facilitates clear conversations about progress made by students and caregivers/parents who support their students.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal](media/parent-student-portal-1.png "Parent and student portal")

Here students can see all their assignments and progress made with each, as well as focus on a particular subject to see only those assignments.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal](media/parent-student-portal-2.png "Parent and student portal")

Students can also easily check grades and test scores.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal](media/parent-student-portal-3.png "Parent and student portal")

As well as other important details like attendance.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal](media/parent-student-portal-4.png "Parent and student portal")

And explore extracurricular activities offered at their schools.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal](media/parent-student-portal-5.png "Parent and student portal")

Parents can also easily update their family information for the school, include important medical forms and more.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Parent and student portal](media/parent-student-portal-6.png "Parent and student portal")

## Model-driven app

Administrators can have a complete view of attendance, courses, internships, accomplishments, extra-curricular activities, interventions, assessments, and behavior incidents. The Administrator sees this single view to access information for their students and take informed actions to support students.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Administrator view](media/edu-admin-view.png "Administrator view")

## Donor management app

Administrators can use the donor app to view and manage donors and update them how their donations are being utilized by the school.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Donor management view](media/edu-donor-mgmt-view.png "Donor management view")

The Administrators can also easily get a clear view of donation designations.

## Student behavior app

Administrators can easily record, track, and encourage positive behavior from students.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Student behavior view](media/behavior-view.png "Student behavior view")

They can also better understand details on how students earned recognition for positive behaviors in class.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Student behavior incident view](media/behavior-view-2.png "Student behavior incident view")

## Student attendance app

Educators can easily track and reports attendance in the Attendance application. This application can also be modified to use on a table or phone to increase ease of using it.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Student attendance view](media/attendance-app.png "Student attendance view")

## Attendance Power BI template

Attendance Power BI report dashboard allows Educators to easily view the attendance data and take action on it.
