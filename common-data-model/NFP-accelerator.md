# The Dynamics 365 Nonprofit Accelerator

This accelerator was announced at the initial Microsoft CXO Summit in [April 2018](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/04/20/new-solutions-to-help-nonprofits-drive-impact) and released in [November 2018](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/11/08/new-dynamics-365-nonprofit-accelerator-supports-organizations-with-end-to-end-solutions)
at the [NetHope Global Summit](https://youtu.be/eV4N0mK0-so?t=2169). The initial release includes these features:

- Extension of the Common Data Model (CDM) to include concepts for managing constituents, raising funds, grants/awards, program delivery, and tracking impact, including entity definitions and relationships.

- Individual, Household and Organization customer-engagement forms that you
    can enhance or use out of the box.

- A sample app for managing constituents that demonstrates some possibilities of
    the Unified Interface.

- Support for building canvas and model-driven apps in PowerApps.

- Support for extending the model with custom entities, forms, and
    relationships that meet your nonprofit needs.

- Support for analytics.

- A solution that's based on Common Data Service and that you can install from AppSource.

- Documentation that helps you adopt the accelerator.

## Sitemap extensions

With the Nonprofit Accelerator plugged in to the Dynamics 365 platform, you can optimize individual aspects of nonprofit business processes, including raising funds, managing grants and awards, program delivery, and tracking impact. You can also leverage the entire constituent-engagement solution within Dynamics 365.

This accelerator adds a nonprofit layer to the rich feature set of the base Dynamics 365 functionality by adding nonprofit entities to record detailed constituent profiles for individuals, households, and organizations. The current data model supports end-to-end fundraising, grants/awards lifecycles, standards-based program delivery, and impact tracking based on the [IATI
standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/).

### IATI (optional add-on)

[IATI](https://iatistandard.org/en/) is a global campaign to more transparently track how aid money is spent. The initiative is designed to ensure that aid money reaches its intended recipients, reduce poverty, and improve standards of living worldwide. Nonprofit organizations can record their fundraising and program-based activities according to the IATI Organizational and Activity Standards.
