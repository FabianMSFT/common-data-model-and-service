# The Dynamics 365 Nonprofit Accelerator

With the Dynamics 365 Nonprofit Accelerator, you can develop nonprofit solutions
based on entities and attributes that nonprofits commonly leverage for
constituent management, fundraising, awards, program delivery and impact
tracking. These entities include but are not limited to donor commitments,
designations, transactions, awards, disbursements, delivery frameworks, results,
indicators, benefit recipients and more. The Accelerator includes the Common
Data Model for Nonprofits, sample apps, sample data, dashboards and
documentation.

This accelerator was announced at the initial Microsoft CXO Summit in [April
2018](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/04/20/new-solutions-to-help-nonprofits-drive-impact)
and initially released in [November
2018](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/11/08/new-dynamics-365-nonprofit-accelerator-supports-organizations-with-end-to-end-solutions)
at the [NetHope Global Summit](https://youtu.be/eV4N0mK0-so?t=2169). Version 2.0
of the Accelerator was announced at the Microsoft CXO Summit in [April
2019.](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/04/04/dynamics-365-nonprofit-accelerator-a-community-solution-to-drive-social-impact/)
and v2.1 in [July
2019](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/07/11/accelerating-opportunities-for-isvs-with-new-programs-and-technology/).

The Nonprofit Accelerator provides the following to partners and customers:

-   Extension of the Common Data Model including concepts for constituent
    management, fundraising, awards, program delivery and impact tracking,
    including entity definitions and relationships.

-   Sample model-driven apps that show how Dynamics 365 and the nonprofit data
    model can be used including constituent management, fundraising, awards and
    delivery frameworks.

-   Support for extending the model with custom entities, forms, and
    relationships that meet your nonprofit needs.

-   Support for building canvas apps in PowerApps.

-   Sample dashboards that provide analytics around fundraising and program
    delivery.

-   A package that you can deploy and install including sample data.

-   Test drive experience through AppSource with walkthroughs, reference guides,
    mapping guides, entity-relationship diagrams and metadata documentation on
    the data model.

-   Optional data integrator templates and mappings for integrating data from
    the Nonprofit Accelerator in Customer Engagement to Finance & Operations

-   Optional volunteer management and IATI add-on common data models, sample
    model-driven apps, sample data, flows and documentation

## Sitemap extensions

When the Nonprofit Accelerator is installed into Dynamics 365, the experience is
transformed into one specifically built for nonprofits. It enables you to
optimize nonprofit operational processes including constituent management,
fundraising, awards, program delivery and impact tracking based on the [IATI
standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/). You can also leverage the entire
constituent-engagement solution within Dynamics 365.

Nonprofits, ISVs, and others in the nonprofit sector can build their solutions
and business processes on top of the new entities and templates found within the
Nonprofit Accelerator. The current data model supports common nonprofit
activities but has been designed to allow flexibility to support other use
cases.

The Nonprofit Accelerator and nonprofit common data model are developed in
collaboration with nonprofits, partners, industry experts and open initiatives
to ensure interoperability and accelerate nonprofit impact.
