# Dynamics 365 education accelerator

Common Data Model helps customers eliminate data silos, enable powerful insights, and act on their own data. This need is nowhere more relevant than in education, where data often deals with students and their ability to navigate a complex system to reach their goals.

Microsoft is working closely with education ISVs around the world. We're working to make Common Data Model more relevant to their needs by shaping the roadmap for the education accelerator together. Microsoft is dedicated to enabling ISVs, partners, and customers to build and focus their efforts on vertical industries in a streamlined approach. The accelerator provides a uniform platform for customers who wish to connect, embed, or extend the Dynamics 365 platform and Microsoft Power Platform.

The education accelerator has the following components:

- [Higher education](hied-accelerator.md)

- [K-12 (primary and secondary schools)](edu-k12-accelerator.md)

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

This section contains answers to frequently asked questions related to the Dynamics 365 education accelerator.

## What is an accelerator? 

Accelerators take the unified data approach of the Power Platform a step further by expediting the development of vertical solutions that use [industry-specific](https://docs.microsoft.com/common-data-model/industry-accelerators) common data models with business logic integration. This enables customers and partners to easily build and customize industry-specific applications that can use data across Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Azure.    

## What can I do if I am unable to install a Dynamics 365 industry accelerator?

The accelerator may be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-Industry-Accelerators) or from AppSource. You may need [PowerApps licenses](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) or other licenses to use the accelerator.  

If the AppSource installation error states that **You do not have permissions to install**, contact the systems administrator. You administrator may also [contact us.](mailto:dynindaccsupport@microsoft.com)  

## What can I do if I am unable to access a Dynamics 365 industry accelerator test drive?

If you are unable to login into the industry accelerator test drive, try opening the test drive in an incognito or private browser window. Use the same login credentials that you provided during signup. If you are still unable to access the test drive in a private window, or have any other issues with installation, [contact us.](mailto:dynindaccsupport@microsoft.com) 
More information: [What is the test drive?](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/want-to-try-an-app-take-a-test-drive)  

## How can I check for an update to a Dynamics 365 industry accelerator? 
To check for an update to an industry accelerator, follow the instructions provided in the [Dynamics 365 Solution Management Docs page. The Docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#environment-level-view-of-apps) also provides instructions on how to install an update. Updates are additive in nature and will only add new features to the pre-existing features you have installed. 
More information: [Dynamics 365 Solution Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/configure-currencies-dyn365-finance/), [Troubleshooting failed installations](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#troubleshooting-a-failed-installation)  

## Is there an on-premises version available for the Dynamics 365 industry accelerators? 
Managing siloed data is a struggle for many organizations. As a result, we are currently not supporting on-premises software with our managed solutions. Currently, the Dynamics 365 industry accelerators can only be installed as off-premises software. 

## How many times can I utilize the test drive for the Dynamics 365 industry accelerators? 
The test drives are available on AppSource, and once initialized, they are available for 24 hours. This 24-hour trial period cannot be extended and is only available once. The trial allows you to share the test drive with other users, but you must use the same credentials. If you would like to continue to use the accelerator after the 24-hour trial period, please create a [trial organization on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 page.](https://trials.dynamics.com)  

## Is localization offered for the Dynamics 365 industry accelerators? 
Currently, the industry accelerators are offered in American English, and utilize the customary system. However, you can use a different currency other than the U.S. Dollar. When you create a Dynamics 365 organization, you must define your default (base) currency. The base currency applies to all monetary values in the system. 
More information: [Defining default currency for Dynamics 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/configure-currencies-dyn365-finance/)   

## Can I connect Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central to the Dynamics 365 industry accelerators? 

Currently, the industry accelerators do not have integration with [Business Central.](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/)
