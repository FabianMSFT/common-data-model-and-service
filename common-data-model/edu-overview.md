# Dynamics 365 education accelerator

Common Data Model helps customers eliminate data silos, enable powerful insights, and act on their own data. This need is nowhere more relevant than in education, where data often deals with students and their ability to navigate a complex system to reach their goals.

Microsoft is working closely with education ISVs around the world. We're working to make Common Data Model more relevant to their needs by shaping the roadmap for the education accelerator together. Microsoft is dedicated to enabling ISVs, partners, and customers to build and focus their efforts on vertical industries in a streamlined approach. The accelerator provides a uniform platform for customers who wish to connect, embed, or extend the Dynamics 365 platform and Power Platform.

The education accelerator has the following components:

- [Higher education](hied-accelerator.md)

- [K-12 (primary and secondary schools)](edu-k12-accelerator.md)
