## Entities

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|[Account](Account.md)|Business that represents a customer or a potential customer. The company that's billed in business transactions.  |
|[Address](Address.md)|Address and shipping information. Used to store additional addresses for an account or a contact.  |
|[Award](Award.md)|The total amount of funding that has been agreed to be awarded to an individual or an institution and related data, including but not limited to the recipient, the date of the award, and the purpose of the award.  |
|[AwardVersion](AwardVersion.md)|A point-in-time snapshot of the attributes of an award.  |
|[Budget](Budget.md)|Amount of funds that can be designated for an objective, a delivery framework (i.e., a program or a project), or both for a given period of time.  |
|[Campaign](Campaign.md)|Container for campaign activities and responses, sales literature, products, and lists to create, plan, execute, and track the results of a specific marketing campaign through its life.  |
|[Contact](Contact.md)|Person with whom a business unit has a relationship, such as a customer, a supplier, or a colleague.  |
|[CreditPlan](CreditPlan.md)|Information about who will be credited with hard or soft credits after a payment clears. A credit plan could "count" for membership or other benefit before a payment actually clears. A credit plan appears as a line item that's attached to a pledge, a payment schedule, or an account. The goal of a credit plan is to avoid the double counting of hard, soft, and split crediting. The most elegant way to manage a credit plan is by ensuring that business rules are in place, such as an "auto" soft credit rule that's attached to an account, a contact, an opportunity, or a donor commitment depending on the conditions met. Credit plans can count toward fulfilling a benefit even if they are never fully realized as a hard or soft credit.  |
|[CreditRecipient](CreditRecipient.md)|The contact, donor, or constituent who receives "credit" for the hard or soft cleared payment. A credit plan is always tied to a recipient in order to ensure full reconciliation and accounting of donations. All nonprofits have business rules that govern how hard and soft credits are applied, but these rules are notoriously inconsistent from organization to organization. For example, we recently surveyed 12 enterprise nonprofits about how they handle third-party (corporate) giving crediting. Of those organizations, half of them soft credit the corporation and hard credit the individual donors, and the other half hard credit the third-party organization that provides the matching gift payments. (For example, Benevity is a third-party gift-management company.) Still other organizations hard credit the corporations themselves. For example, Jane Smith works at Microsoft and donates $50 through that company. Microsoft matches the gift dollar for dollar, but Benevity collects and distributes the gift to Oxfam International. Where is hard and soft credit applied? Some organizations hard credit Jane Smith $100 ($50 donated plus the $50 match). Other organizations hard credit Jane Smith $50 and Microsoft $50. Some organizations hard credit Microsoft $100. Still more organizations hard credit Benevity some or all of the $100 donation.  |
|[DeliveryFramework](DeliveryFramework.md)|A management unit of work that the organization or entity doing the work defines.  |
|[DesignatedCredit](DesignatedCredit.md)|A segment of a donation payment or an in-kind gift that indicates the partial amount that's hard-credited or soft-credited to a customer and allocated to one designation.  |
|[Designation](Designation.md)|An area to which funds may be allocated, including a GL-relevant accounting code. A designation indicates how a donor wants an organization to spend or earmark a donation.  All nonprofit organizations strive to secure the largest percent of unrestricted or undesignated funds possible so that they can use this money at their own discretion toward the areas of greatest need, including the ability to pay down their operating costs.  Nonprofit organizations that are oriented toward direct marketing or whose missions are aligned to causes, cures, and global issues (such as Oxfam) tend to have as few designations as they possibly can (~100-200 total designations) because those kinds of organizations derive the majority of their funds from donors giving small gift amounts.  Such organizations also focus on recurring giving programs, which have a high administration cost if gifts are permitted to be designated or split-designated across multiple funds.  A higher-education organization, on the other hand, derives a large percent of its annual fundraising from major donors, who typically want much more control about where they're directing their gifts.  |
|[DesignationPlan](DesignationPlan.md)|A line item that's attached to a pledge, a payment schedule, or a campaign and that indicates how associated payments should be designated.  Sometimes, all of a donation is designated to a single fund (ideally, to an unrestricted fund that the nonprofit can use any way it wishes).  Other times, a donor has specified that the donation should be "split designated" among two or more funds.  For example, a donor giving $5,000 might specify that $1,000 goes to the unrestricted fund, $1,000 to the new-building fund, and $3,000 to build water wells in sub-Saharan Africa.  |
|[Disbursement](Disbursement.md)|An award disbursement to an individual or an organizational awardee.  A disbursement is related to a specific award and budget through a disbursement distribution.  |
|[DisbursementDistribution](DisbursementDistribution.md)|Defines the delivery framework(s), such as a program, a project, or an initiative, that contributes to funding an award disbursement.  |
|[Docket](Docket.md)|Associates inquiries (LOIs) and requests with a specific grant/award cycle or date (usually a review or board meeting) on which a foundation will make final decisions about applications.  |
|[DonorCommitment](DonorCommitment.md)|Tracks how frequently constituents donate funds to a nonprofit or a foundation.  All nonprofits and foundations seek to attract as many monthly, recurring, or sustaining gifts or donor commitments as they can.  Other donors routinely give on a one-time basis.  Monthly givers require additional tracking of payments and transaction information, such as payment method, schedules, and in-kind pledge relevance.  |
|[Education](Education.md)|Biographical information about a contact, including the educational institutions that a contact attended or is attending, the areas of study (major/minor) on which the contact concentrated, activities and roles that the contact pursued, preferences (such as football booster or patron of the on-campus art museum), and the start and end dates that are associated with this information.  It's particularly important for mid-level and major gift fundraisers that are based in the United States to understand each contact's university or college alumni/alumnae network and peers to build a bigger pipeline of qualified prospects.  University/college association isn't as relevant or important in the United Kingdom, for example, compared to the United States.  Nonprofit organizations with a bigger focus on major gifts care more about tracking educational information at a deeper level.  |
|[EmploymentHistory](EmploymentHistory.md)|Historical and/or current information about where a contact works, volunteers, or serves in some capacity at an organization.  Nonprofit organizations track employer information to understand whether the employee is part of an eligible matching-gift program, to gain visibility into an employee's "network" to visualize the degrees of separation between an employee and other prospective donors that the organization wants to solicit, and other reasons.  |
|[Indicator](Indicator.md)|Describes what will be measured to track evidence of a result. Indicators can be qualitative or quantitative and may or may not be aggregable.  |
|[IndicatorValue](IndicatorValue.md)|A quantitative or qualitative value of measurement of an indicator.  |
|[Lead](Lead.md)|A prospect or a potential sales opportunity. Leads are converted into accounts, contacts, or opportunities when they're qualified. Otherwise, they're deleted or archived.  |
|[Objective](Objective.md)|Used to report on goals or strategies outside of program boundaries.  For example, "Advocacy" may be an objective of both "Health Care" and "Education." An objective is often a step above a program in terms of hierarchy.  So, a foundation may have five key objectives to fund for a particular fiscal year.  Related and underneath objectives (such as advocacy, job training, and literacy) might be any number of additional, related programs, all of which seek to award grants to qualified applicants.  |
|[OfacMatch](OfacMatch.md)|Prospective, pending, and closed "deals" or gifts.  In this entity, nonprofit organizations can track their efforts to build relationships with prospective donors.  This information is commonly tracked on opportunities:  assigned fundraiser(s), ask amounts, and campaigns to which designated funds were given.  Opportunity-pipeline management allows development and gift officers to forecast likely gifts by when they're going to close, very similar to how a salesperson tracks and manages sales opportunities. To measure the ROI of specific marketing programs, it must be possible in a CRM product or application to associate an opportunity with a campaign.  |
|[Opportunity](Opportunity.md)|Potential revenue-generating event or a sale to an account, which must be tracked through a sales process to completion.  |
|[PaymentAsset](PaymentAsset.md)|Specific types of payments (such as in-kind gifts, stock, and securities) that are classified as assets require nonprofits to follow specific reporting rules.  Managing these gifts tends to be very manual work for the development-operations staff of nonprofit organizations.  These gifts come in through a bank and must be manually reviewed and entered into a batch.  Often questions must be answered before a gift entry can be completed with ease.  |
|[PaymentMethod](PaymentMethod.md)|A parent entity for payment-method customizations that an application may support.  Extensions could support credit cards, EFT, cryptocurrency, mobile payments, or rewards points.  |
|[PaymentProcessor](PaymentProcessor.md)|A placeholder entity that the Payment Method object references.  This entity is intended to be customized with configuration data necessary to connect to a payment processor and authorize payments.  |
|[PaymentSchedule](PaymentSchedule.md)|A gift transaction can be a one-time payment or a recurring payment (that is, monthly or sustainer giving). In addition, the gift can be a pledge (that is, a promise) of a future payment or a current/received payment.  |
|[PlannedGiving](PlannedGiving.md)|A planned gift is a major gift that's made during a donor's lifetime or at the time of their death and that involves their estate and tax planning.  There are many forms of planned giving, but the three most common vehicles are CRTs (Charitable Remainder Trusts), bequests, and annuities, which all have different tax benefits and financial-reconciliation guidelines for the nonprofit organization. Planned gifts are in contrast to annual gifts, which are made through a donor's discretionary income and not tied to an estate.  |
|[Preference](Preference.md)|Typically tracks an abundance of constituent or organization information that doesn't live cleanly on an account or contact record or that can be associated with both an account and a contact.  Examples:  personal interests, additional communication preferences such as interest in a newsletter, specific outreach that the constituent wants, and additional affiliation information, such as constituent type associations and ratings.|
|[Recommendation](Recommendation.md)|The mechanism through which foundations provide recommendations back to a grant applicant.  |
|[Report](Report.md)|A status report that an awardee submits to the granting entity (that is, a foundation) to report on what impact has been accomplished to date through the funds that were awarded.  |
|[Request](Request.md)|A request from an individual or institution for funding or support. A request is more formal than an inquiry (LOI) and typically happens after an inquiry has already occurred.  |
|[Result](Result.md)|A result is a container that represents the changes in the context in which an organization operates delivery frameworks (that is, programs and projects).  |
|[Review](Review.md)|The internal assessment that a staff member (or team) makes of a request and all of the relevant information that must be tracked at the "review" stage of an application.  |
|[Salutation](Salutation.md)|The way a donor or prospect is commonly addressed via written communication, such as hard-copy letters and email messages.  Nonprofits and foundations typically address major donors by different salutations depending on the scenario.  A medical doctor could be addressed as "Doctor Smith" when the organization reaches out regarding in-country field volunteerism that the person performs.  On the other hand, the same individual might be referred to as "Mrs. Smith" as part of her household being solicited for a major gift.  |
|[Transaction](Transaction.md)|Payments or donations from a donor, a contact, an account, or an organization to the nonprofit.  Transaction records must track valuable information about the gift or items transferred from a constituent to a nonprofit organization.  Critical transaction information to capture and provide audit capabilities around include what payment method was used; through what channel the gift came in; whether an adjustment was made, on what date, and for what amount; when the transaction was received, processed, and reconciled; and other data.  |
