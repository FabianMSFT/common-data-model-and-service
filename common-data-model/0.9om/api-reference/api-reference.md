# API Reference

## Overview

In this section, you will find the specifications for the Common Data Model APIs that are public. There are three sub-sections to this API reference:

* [Object Model](cdm/cdm.md) contains the specifications for the core Common Data Model object model APIs.

* [Storage]() contains the specifications for the APIs used to interact with Common Data Model files.

* [Utilities]() contains the specifications for the utility APIs that are commonly used.

Please note that this API reference only contains the specifications for public APIs. Internal APIs are not meant to be used. These APIs are marked with the `internal` access modifier in C#, the `@Deprecated` tag in Java, a leading underscore in Python, and the `@internal` tag in TypeScript.
